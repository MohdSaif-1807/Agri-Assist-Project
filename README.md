# Agri-Assist-Project

Welcome to Agri-Assist Project, an innovative agricultural application designed to tackle key challenges in farming using cutting-edge technology. This project, developed with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and integrated with a Flask API, encompasses two distinct modules. These modules cater to crop-related issues and enable yield marketing through an intuitive e-commerce platform.

## Features

### Crop-related Issues Module

- **Plant Disease Prediction:** Employing advanced algorithms to predict and identify plant diseases for proactive management.
- **Crop Selection:** Utilizes detailed soil and climate information to recommend suitable crops for cultivation.

### Yield Marketing Module

- **E-commerce Platform:** Empowering farmers to seamlessly post and sell their crops, creating a dynamic virtual marketplace.
- **User Roles:** Designed for farmers and common people for purchasing.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, utilizing CSS frameworks such as MUI and react-bootstrap.
- **Middleware:** Leveraging Express.js for efficient communication between frontend and backend.
- **Backend:** Powered by Node.js for orchestrating complex operations.
- **API:** Flask, providing additional functionality and seamless integration.
- **Database:** MongoDB stores user credentials, while AWS S3 bucket is used for image storage.
